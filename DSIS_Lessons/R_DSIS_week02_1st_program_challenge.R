## Instructions:
##
## These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.
##
## Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits.
## Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step.
## You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course.
## Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course.
## Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready.

## Steps for the Challenge
##
## (1a) Write a program to create a numeric vector of arbitrary length. An arbitrary choice is a selection of any number you want to select.
##
## (1b) What is the count or the total number of elements in the vector? Hint: print the length() of the vector in the console. 
##
## (2a) Create a numeric vector of random length. A random choice is made using a random number generator like the D20 dice you have or the sample() function.
##
## (2b) Count the total number of elements in the vector.
##
## (3) Select any integer (arbitrary choice) and create a new object. Now, answer the following logical question: are any() of the elements in one of the vectors created in step (1) or step (2) the same value as the selected integer?
##
## warning: it's going to be even more challenging below.
##
## (4) Write a function using the program written in step (3). Hint: "Wrap" the program from step (3) in a function.
