# Introduction
## Course Content
Learn to program, program to learn. This class will provide undergraduate students with an introduction to the scientific method and programming tools for data science. Students will learn the fundamentals of the scientific method and, through programming and research design, how to improve both causal inference and the measurement of international political phenomena.

## Course Objectives
Students will learn how to design studies to take advantage of the wealth of information contained in new online datasets such as data available from Social Media, newly digitized document corpuses now available online, and event-based datasets such as the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data) dataset. The focus of the course is on building data science tools in such a way as to maximize the validity of inferences obtained from complex datasets like these. 

- Learn to program, program to learn.
- Learn to program in R using the base package and a minimal number of other packages
- Collect and analyze international relations data using R
- Use the tools from research design to understand the what we can and cannot determine about the relationship between two or more variables

How will we go about learning these tools? In this class, we will learn to program and program to learn. What do I mean? First, we will use the R program environment to learn the building blocks of programming. As we develop programming skills in R, we will use them to help us understand how different types of data analysis tools work. For example, by the end of the course, students will be able to program and evaluate a model of data from several datasets of interest to students of world politics and international relations.

The primary learning tool in this  course is participation with a set of \textbf{Program Challenges}. I have designed a set of programming tools that students can then use to explore and understand the basic building blocks of any statistical model or data science question that students encounter. The program challenges are designed to be increasingly challenging, but also fun and collaborative. I push my students to think creatively, while also reminding them that getting stuck or not finishing all the steps in any program challenge is expected and encouraged, because it is a sign that they are learning. I have designed the program challenges and other programing and statistical material to be extensible so that students with limited skills all the way to advanced skills can learn from the material. I explain in each program challenge that students should always start with step 1 and then continue to each step as time permits. I also emphasize that the students should not worry about completing each step but that they may wish to come back to steps that they found difficult as they progress through the course. Each student will find different steps challenging and this is where the individualized learning takes place. These structural choices allow students from diverse educational backgrounds to learn and grow in my class. 

Students learn in my course by finding the challenging steps in the Program Challenge that we use each week of the course. Students discover which steps in the Program Challenge are difficult for them and grow by tackling these steps. I encourage my students to show me where they are getting stuck so that I can help them make progress. Not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged because the extensible structure of each Program Challenge means that any student can learn from making it through just a few steps. As students learn and gain confidence, they can return to the more difficult step in a Program Challenge from an earlier week in the course to learn and grow even more. This is an important requirement in my course, because at the midterm and final exam period, I ask my students to go back and complete additional difficult steps from their favorite program challenges.

# Schedule of Lessons and Program Challenges
**Description of Weekly Lessons:** Each monday, we will spend 1 to 2 hours of class time in which I review R programming concepts. Please make sure to read the assigned chapters and view the video lectures before each weeks classes so that you are ready to program in class. These weekly lessons will review key information from the weekly reading assignments. Lessons will also be recorded and will be available online.
<br> 

**Description of Program Challenges:** On Wednesday, we will work together in a lab-base setting to complete a program challenge in R. These program challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works. Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits. Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step. You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course. Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course. Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready. The program challenges will occur on Wednesdays throughout the semester.

# Additional Course Information 
## Office Hours
- The best way to contact me in order to ask additional questions about course material is to attend office hours. I hold extensive office hours each week online on zoom and in-person in the atrium area on the first floor of the Institute for Social Research (ISR) building, which is located at 426 Thompson St., Ann Arbor, MI 48104. Just like in the class room, office hours sessions are designed to be an open and inclusive learning environment for my students. The ISR atrium offers an open space that accommodates small to medium size groups. There will often be more than one student seeking feedback during office hours. Each of you are welcome to join the group office hours session and ask questions or participate in discussion. I am also available outside of office hours via a message on the course management software (Canvas) or ay my umich email address: cjfariss@umich.edu.
- There may be instances when students must miss class due to their commitment to officially represent the University. These students may be involved in the performing arts, scientific or artistic endeavors, or intercollegiate athletics. Absence from classes while representing the University does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course missed during the period of absence. Students should provide reasonable notice for dates of anticipated absences and submit an individualized class excuse form.
- Students will need to schedule a makeup session with the instructor if they miss class on either Monday or Wednesday.
<br>

## Chat GPT Policy
- My advice for this class: *don't use Chat GPT or google search*. But ...  
- You may choose to use U-M GPT or another Chat GPT program in this course. 
- The University of Michigan provides access to a U-M GPT tool, which you read more about here: https://its.umich.edu/computing/ai/gpt-in-depth
- **If you choose to use U-M GPT or another Chat GPT program, you must submit (1) the prompt used to generate the output, (2) the specific GPT program used, and (3) the date and time you entered the prompt.**
- You can read more about creating effective prompts here: https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=10680.
 <br>

## Active Learning Attendence Policy 
- As students, we learn more when we actively engage with material instead of passively consuming it. This insight is supported by extensive research from college-level courses. Participation and therefore attendance is critical for achieving our shared learning goals and is therefore mandatory. We will program in class together each week during our class sessions. 
- **Participation**: 40% of your grade will be based on participation in our in classroom discussions about the assigned readings, participating in the active learning tasks (program challenges), and several short surveys.  I will award half of the participation points for the first half (week 1-8) of the semester and half of the participation points for the second half of the semester (week 9-15). Active learning tasks (synchronous) and Class Video events (synchronous or asynchronous) both count towards the participation grade.  The purpose of the participation component in this class, particularly during the Wednesday labs and office hours, is to participate in the intellectual learning environment with both the instructors and your peers in addition to demonstrating your individual learning process and learning accomplishments over the course of the semester. Participation is both a critical component to learning and one of the primary methods by which I evaluate learning progress in this course.
- Monday lessons will be recorded via zoom and available online. If you cannot attend class in person, you are welcome to join class virtually via zoom or watch the recorded lesson at a later time. If you are sick, I want you to take the time to rest and recover fully. I will help you catch up with the course material. If you miss a Monday lesson session, you will need to schedule a makeup session with the instructor during Office Hours.
- Wednesday lab sessions will focus on the program challenges and attendance is required. The program challenges are available to work on outside of class and during office hours as well. Please feel free to use office hours to ask questions about these challenges as you work through them. If you miss a Wednesday lab session, you will need to schedule a makeup session with the instructor.
<br>

## Student Mental Health and Wellbeing
- This is a recommendation made by the Central Student Government and endorsed by the LSA Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education.
- University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. \\
- For help, contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (734) 764-8312 and https://caps.umich.edu/ during and after hours, on weekends and holidays, or through its counselors physically located in schools on both North and Central Campus. 
- You may also consult University Health Service (UHS) at (734) 764-8320 and https://www.uhs.umich.edu/mentalhealthsvcs, or for alcohol or drug concerns, see www.uhs.umich.edu/aodresources.  
- For a listing of other mental health resources available on and off campus, visit: \\ {\tt \small http://umich.edu/~mhealth/}.
<br>

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
- If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please let me know at your earliest convenience. Some aspects of this course, the assignments, the in-class activities, and the way the course is usually taught may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As soon as you make me aware of your needs, we can work with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office to help us determine appropriate academic accommodations. SSD (734-763-3000; http://ssd.umich.edu) typically recommends accommodations through a Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will be treated as such. 
<br>

## Religious and Academic Conflicts
- This language comes from the Provost's Office's Guidance to Students on Conflicts between the Academic and Religious Calendars.
- Although the University of Michigan, as an institution, does not observe religious holidays, it has long been the University's policy that every reasonable effort should be made to help students avoid negative academic consequences when their religious obligations conflict with academic requirements.  Absence from classes or examinations for religious reasons does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence.  Students who expect to miss classes, examinations, or other assignments as a consequence of their religious observance shall be provided with a reasonable alternative opportunity to complete such academic responsibilities. 
- It is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious holidays on which they will be absent.  Such notice must be given by the drop/add deadline of the given term. Students who are absent on days of examinations or class assignments shall be offered an opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, unless it can be demonstrated that a make-up opportunity would interfere unreasonably with the delivery of the course.  Should disagreement arise over any aspect of this policy, the parties involved should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies/Director of Graduate Studies.  Final appeals will be resolved by the Provost. 
<br>

## Academic Integrity 
- The LSA undergraduate academic community, like all communities, functions best when its members treat one another with honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. The College holds all members of its community to high standards of scholarship and integrity. To accomplish its mission of providing an optimal educational environment and developing leaders of society, the College promotes the assumption of personal responsibility and integrity and prohibits all forms of academic dishonesty and misconduct. Academic dishonesty may be understood as any action or attempted action that may result in creating an unfair academic advantage for oneself or an unfair academic advantage or disadvantage for any other member or members of the academic community. Conduct, without regard to motive, that violates the academic integrity and ethical standards of the College community cannot be tolerated. The College seeks vigorously to achieve compliance with its community standards of academic integrity. Violations of the standards will not be tolerated and will result in serious consequences and disciplinary action.
