# R_Program_Challenges 

Program Challenges created for various courses. 

R Data Science for International Studies Program Challenges designed for undergraduate political science and international studies students programming in R. See the course syllabus for additional details.

These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works.
