# Introduction
## Course Content
Learn to program, program to learn. This class will provide undergraduate students with an introduction to the scientific method and programming tools for data science. Students will learn the fundamentals of the scientific method and, through programming and research design, how to improve both causal inference and the measurement of international political phenomena.

## Course Objectives
Students will learn how to design studies to take advantage of the wealth of information contained in new online datasets such as data available from Social Media, newly digitized document corpuses now available online, and event-based datasets such as the ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data) dataset. The focus of the course is on building data science tools in such a way as to maximize the validity of inferences obtained from complex datasets like these. 

- Learn to program, program to learn.
- Learn to program in R using the base package and a minimal number of other packages
- Collect and analyze international relations data using R
- Use the tools from research design to understand the what we can and cannot determine about the relationship between two or more variables

How will we go about learning these tools? In this class, we will learn to program and program to learn. What do I mean? First, we will use the R program environment to learn the building blocks of programming. As we develop programming skills in R, we will use them to help us understand how different types of data analysis tools work. For example, by the end of the course, students will be able to program and evaluate a model of data from several datasets of interest to students of world politics and international relations.

The primary learning tool in this  course is participation with a set of \textbf{Program Challenges}. I have designed a set of programming tools that students can then use to explore and understand the basic building blocks of any statistical model or data science question that students encounter. The program challenges are designed to be increasingly challenging, but also fun and collaborative. I push my students to think creatively, while also reminding them that getting stuck or not finishing all the steps in any program challenge is expected and encouraged, because it is a sign that they are learning. I have designed the program challenges and other programing and statistical material to be extensible so that students with limited skills all the way to advanced skills can learn from the material. I explain in each program challenge that students should always start with step 1 and then continue to each step as time permits. I also emphasize that the students should not worry about completing each step but that they may wish to come back to steps that they found difficult as they progress through the course. Each student will find different steps challenging and this is where the individualized learning takes place. These structural choices allow students from diverse educational backgrounds to learn and grow in my class. 

Students learn in my course by finding the challenging steps in the Program Challenge that we use each week of the course. Students discover which steps in the Program Challenge are difficult for them and grow by tackling these steps. I encourage my students to show me where they are getting stuck so that I can help them make progress. Not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged because the extensible structure of each Program Challenge means that any student can learn from making it through just a few steps. As students learn and gain confidence, they can return to the more difficult step in a Program Challenge from an earlier week in the course to learn and grow even more. This is an important requirement in my course, because at the midterm and final exam period, I ask my students to go back and complete additional difficult steps from their favorite program challenges.

# Schedule of Lessons and Program Challenges
### Description of Weekly Lessons
Each monday, we will spend 1 to 2 hours of class time in which I review R programming concepts. Please make sure to read the assigned chapters and view the video lectures before each weeks classes so that you are ready to program in class. These weekly lessons will review key information from the weekly reading assignments. Lessons will also be recorded and will be available online.
<br> 

### Description of Program Challenges
These challenges are meant to be just that, challenging. They should also be fun. I encourage you to think creatively and collaboratively. Getting stuck or not finishing all the steps is expected and encouraged. This is how learning works. Always start with step (1) and then continue to each step as time permits. Don't worry about completing each step. Document your code for each step. You may wish to come back to some of the harder steps as you progress through the course. Note that some of the steps may ask you to use skills we have not yet covered in the course. Don't worry about these steps now but definitely think through the programming logic if you are stuck and make plans to come back to try them once you feel ready. The program challenges will occur on Wednesdays throughout the semester.

## Chat GPT Policy
- My advice for this class: *don't use Chat GPT or google search*. But ...  
- You may choose to use U-M GPT or another Chat GPT program in this course. 
- The University of Michigan provides access to a U-M GPT tool, which you read more about here: https://its.umich.edu/computing/ai/gpt-in-depth
- **If you choose to use U-M GPT or another Chat GPT program, you must submit (1) the prompt used to generate the output, (2) the specific GPT program used, and (3) the date and time you entered the prompt.**
- You can read more about creating effective prompts here: https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=10680.
